datetime (built-in)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NEO1_MDS_Converter.git
cd NEO1_MDS_Converter
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas numpy requests
```

### 3. Configure Folder Paths
Edit the configuration section in `Amex processor.py`:

## üîß Configuration

### Business Rules
The converter follows these business rules:

- **Vendor Account**: Always set to "AMEX" (paying Amex, not original vendor)
- **Company Code**: Set to "BLM"
- **GL Codes**: Preserved from Field 1 value code in source data
- **Invoice Descriptions**: Include real vendor name and expense purpose
- **Filtering**: Negative amounts (credits) are automatically filtered out
- **Due Date**: Transaction date + 8 days
- **Invoice Numbers**: Generated as 8-character hexadecimal hashes

### Customizable Settings
You can modify these settings in the `AmexToMDSTransformer` class:

```python
class AmexToMDSTransformer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.company_code = "BLM"           # Change company code
        self.vendor_account = "AMEX"        # Change vendor account
        self.due_date_offset_days = 8       # Change due date offset
        self.images_folder = "Receipt_Images"  # Change images folder name
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Missing Required Columns
**Error**: `Missing required columns: ['Billing Total Gross Amount']`
**Solution**: Ensure your CSV file contains all required columns with exact names

#### 2. No Positive Transactions Found
**Error**: `WARNING: No positive transactions found after filtering!`
**Solution**: Check if your CSV contains positive amounts (not all credits)

#### 3. Image Download Issues
**Problem**: Images not downloading from neo1.com
**Solutions**:
- Ensure you're logged into neo1.com in your browser
- Check that the Image URL column contains valid URLs
- Try downloading images manually using the URLs file

#### 4. Permission Errors
**Error**: `Permission denied` when creating folders
**Solution**: Run the script with appropriate permissions or change folder paths

### Debug Mode
For detailed debugging, you can add logging to the script:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: The tool processes financial data locally on your machine
- **No Data Transmission**: No data is sent to external servers
- **Local Storage**: All files are stored locally in your specified folders
- **Image URLs**: Receipt image URLs are from neo1.com (your expense management system)
